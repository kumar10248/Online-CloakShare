# Online CloakShare

This project is a clipboard application that allows users to save text or upload files temporarily. The saved text or uploaded files are accessible via a unique code and can be set to be automatically deleted after a specified time.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Users can upload a file from their local system. The file size should be less than 100MB.
- **Expiration Time**: Users can set an expiration time for the uploaded file. The maximum expiration time is 2880 minutes.
- **File Retrieval**: Users can retrieve the uploaded file using a unique code provided after the file upload.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Users can copy the unique code to their clipboard.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in both the `client` and `server` directories.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev` in the `client` directory.
4. Start the backend server by running `node index.js` in the `server` directory.
